# D3 Watchout Game

The D3 library is widely used for data modeling. Instead of creating yet another example of data modeling using D3 I have decided to implement D3 through the creation of a game.

The game has meteors that will constantly fly through the playing arena on the screen. The player is represented by a dot that is randomly located in the playing arena at the start of the game.

As long as the player is not hit by a moving meteor then their score increases. Every time they are hit the score is rest to 0.
